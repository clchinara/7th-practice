# 7th-practice

A lightweight practice driller for 7th chords and their inversions: https://clchinara.github.io/7th-practice/. 

## What this is for

This tool is made for quick *visual drilling* of 7th chords in two complementary practice modes:

### 1. Sight-reading mode (*Reveal chord later* OFF)
- The chord symbol, inversion, and staff diagram are shown together
- Use this mode to learn and reinforce 7th chords by sight
- Focus on recognizing chord quality, inversion, and spacing at a glance

### 2. Active recall mode (*Reveal chord later* ON)
- Only the chord symbol and inversion are shown at first
- Use the interval to:
  - find the chord tones mentally
  - play the chord on your instrument
  - visualize the staff notation
- The diagram is revealed after the interval to check your answer

## How to practice

1. Open the sidebar to select or exclude:
   - root notes
   - chord qualities
   - inversions
2. Set an interval (in seconds).
3. Let the chord prompt appear.
4. Depending on the mode:
   - read and absorb the notation (sight-reading)
   - or find and play the chord before the reveal (active recall)
5. Use *Pause / Continue* to stop and think when needed.

Suggested practice ideas:
- Limit roots or inversions to focus on weak areas
- Slow tempo (6–10s) for learning new chord types
- Faster tempo (2–4s) for automatic recognition
- Say chord tones or inversion names out loud
- Alternate between both modes in one session

## Features

- Randomized 7th chords (maj7, m7, 7)
- Root position and all inversions
- Selectors for roots, qualities, and inversions
- Adjustable interval timing
- Optional delayed chord reveal
